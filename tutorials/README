# How to make a tutorial:

Every tutorial should be composed of 4 files:
	1-) A .c file that'll be run by exec, name should be: tutorial.<n>.c where n is an integer ranging from {1..99999999999999}
	2-) A .txt file that is the script that should be printed, name should be: tutorial.<n>.txt, where n is the same as the one
		from the name of .c file
	3-) A .gdb file that'll be run as a batch script on gdb. Name should be tutorial.<n>.gdb
	4-) A python script that should produce gdb files that'll be used by tutorial script. Name should be tutorial.<n>.py
