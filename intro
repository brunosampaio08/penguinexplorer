Hi! So this is your first time using penguinExplorer! Let's have a tour.
On the upper left corner, we have the prompt. This is where you can type ~almost~ any GNU/Linux shell command and it will run.
On the lower left corner, we have the command window. This will be used in tutorials, and you will run debugging commands on it.
Where you are reading this, it's the tutorial window. Some important info about usage and the tutorials will be printed here.
On the right side, we have the stack window. There, addresses and values of the running program's stack and frame will be shown.
If this is your first time, I recommend you start by running the first tutorial. When you get control of the prompt, type "tutorial -n 1" and it'll start.
Now, I'll move you to the prompt and you're free. Bye, see you soon!
